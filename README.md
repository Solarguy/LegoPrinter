LegoPrinter
===========

This is the source code for a little LEGO printer that I made.  It will eventually be able to be a 3D printer, but for now, while the software is being developed, it will just be 2D.  I am allowing it to be open-source, along with the build files (which are made in Lego Digital Designer).

PLEASE NOTE:

This project uses LeJOS, a java firmware replacement for the Lego NXT!  It is using the Eclipse IDE and a LeJOS plugin.  For more about this, please visit: http://lejos.sourceforge.net

Keep in mind that this is still in early development, so don't trust the software immediately ;) it may not be working yet.  In the description of the commit is where to look for notes on what is working, and maybe in here.

Thank you!
