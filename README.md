LegoPrinter
===========

This is the source code for a little <i>LEGO printer</i> that I made.  I am allowing it to be open-source, along with the build files.

PLEASE NOTE:

This project use LeJOS, a java firmware replacement for the Lego NXT!  For more about this, please visit: http://lejos.sourceforge.net

Thank you!
